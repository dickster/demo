PHASE 3
-------
make a widget post custom event. e.g. WfPrintEvent.
workflow will listen to said event. -either the wf or state(s) and react.
YesNo widget. with dependent fields (optionally grouped in Div).
template ajax handling? is it needed? how to avoid reflow?
add icon formatter for label (TLBR, icon name)
add link widget (config URL and parameters).
mock out a session spring bean with request scoped spring bean with user info.

maybe save config as json object?
need a replacement for SoapUI.  use GSON?
get groovy working again?  do i need it for states? workflows?
fix validationAdapterFactory serialization issue. (don't use inner classes in @configuration file).
make all configs call generic newInstance(id, this) constructor.
make all variables NOT send in json by default.  you have to explicity include them via @IncludeConfigInJson  //boolean value default true
