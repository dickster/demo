PHASE 3
-------
make a widget post custom event. e.g. WfPrintEvent.
workflow will listen to said event. -either the wf or state(s) and react.
YesNo widget. with dependent fields (optionally grouped in Div).
template ajax handling? is it needed? how to avoid reflow?
add icon formatter for label (TLBR, icon name)
add link widget (config URL and parameters).
mock out a session spring bean with request scoped spring bean with user info.

maybe save config as json object?
need a replacement for SoapUI.  use GSON?
get groovy working again?  do i need it for states? workflows?
fix validationAdapterFactory serialization issue. (don't use inner classes in @configuration file).
make all configs call generic newInstance(id, this) constructor.
make all variables NOT send in json by default.  you have to explicity include them via @IncludeConfigInJson  //boolean value default true



assuming we can leave classes alone.  for example, sectionpanel.

ajax:
1:if element has data-template beside it, copy css.  updateCss($el); <-- recursive.
calls $.find('[data-template]') and calls updateCss() on each.
2:if element contains template-source, the call layout().

non-template.
 - basic widgets checkbox, select picker, text field, formatted label. buttons, section panels?
  (requires basic layout via .js).
template
 - same form with template.
 - also add config for toolips & disabled.
add 2 section panels,  (drivers & vehicles).
same form, add validations (required fields, email, credit card)
validations, chained, re-usable.

add ajax behavior.
add custom typeahead.  (names behavior on same form).
error handling - inline (required...), goto different state, same state with error (target.add .js).
go back and show prevalidations.

different name parsers.

show different themes.
NO BRANCHING.

page 1:
 section panel : driver = name, age, address, occupation.  1..3
 section panel : vehicles = year(selectPickers), make, model   1..5
 # of accidents.
 previous insurer : typeahead.
